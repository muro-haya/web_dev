            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The word "Cars" can refer to several things: a popular animated movie franchise by Pixar,
                 a specific model of vehicle, or even a general term for automobiles. The "Cars" movie series,
                 starting with the 2006 film, features anthropomorphic vehicles in a world where cars are the primary inhabitants.
                 Cars are also fundamental modes of transportation for humans, 
                 typically four-wheeled vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine. </p>
